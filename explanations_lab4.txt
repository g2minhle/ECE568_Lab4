Part 1

We changed the variable email_scope to be "email".

Part 2

Within views/auth.tpl, we copied the code from within getPeopleInfo() and
modified the request to check that the access token is valid. If the request
status was 400, report that the token was invalid. Otherwise, report that the
token is fine, and call getPeopleInfo().

Part 3

Set the SCOPE variable to be drive.file as it provides "Per-file access to
files created or opened by the app". Then include the code from the tutorial
that checks if the auth code is available, and if it's not, generates a URL to
requst access to the Oauth sever, and redirects the user there. Otherwise,
grab the auth code, set the credentials to it, and output the credentials using
the helper function.

Part 4

We start/build the plus and drive service and include the plus.login URL to the
scope to avoid permission errors. Next we gather our profile information and
output that to profile.out. Now that we have a file, we follow the OAuth
example on how to insert a file to the google drive using the google drive
service.
